# Issue: Theme Picker UI and Card Count Logic

## Problem Description

During the implementation of the theme picker UI and card regeneration logic in the MemorizeApp project, the following issues were observed:

- **Card count remained fixed at 4 in GameView preview:**  
  - The preview for `GameView` always showed only 4 cards, regardless of the selected theme.
  - This was due to initializing the view model with `Card.sampleCards` in the preview, which overrode the dynamic card generation logic.
- **Theme picker did not update cards in real-time:**  
  - Although the picker UI was visible and functional, selecting a new theme did not always update the card symbols and count.
  - This was due to missing logic to regenerate cards when the theme changed.
- **Inconsistent behavior between ContentView and GameView:**  
  - `ContentView` preview showed the correct number of cards for each theme, but `GameView` preview did not.

## Analysis

- **Preview Initialization:**  
  - The preview for `GameView` used `GameViewModel(cards: Card.sampleCards)`, which bypassed the theme-based card generation.
- **Binding and State Management:**  
  - The picker’s selection was not always triggering a card regeneration.
  - The `onChange(of:)` modifier or equivalent logic was missing in some cases.
- **Consistency:**  
  - `ContentView` and `GameView` used different initialization methods, leading to inconsistent preview behavior.

## Solution

- **Preview Initialization Fix:**  
  - Updated the preview for `GameView` to use `GameViewModel()` and explicitly call `changeTheme(to:)` with the desired theme.
  - Example:
    ```
    #Preview {
        let viewModel = GameViewModel()
        viewModel.changeTheme(to: .animal)
        return GameView(viewModel: viewModel)
    }
    ```
- **Dynamic Card Generation:**  
  - Modified `changeTheme(to:)` in `GameViewModel` to generate card pairs from the theme’s symbols.
  - Ensured that the card count matches the theme’s symbol count × 2.
- **Picker Binding and State Update:**  
  - Added `onChange(of:)` to the picker in `GameView` to ensure that card regeneration happens whenever the theme changes.
- **Consistency:**  
  - Standardized the initialization of `GameViewModel` across `ContentView` and `GameView` to ensure consistent behavior.

## Lessons Learned

- **Preview initialization should mirror actual app usage as closely as possible.**
- **Dynamic data generation logic should not be bypassed in previews.**
- **State management and binding should be carefully reviewed to ensure UI updates.**
- **Consistency between views is crucial for a predictable user experience.**

# Issue: Unable to Hit Breakpoint in `setUp()` of UI Test Target

## Description

While attempting to debug the `setUp()` method in the `MemorizeAppUITests` target, the following issues were observed:

- **Breakpoint set in `setUp()` did not trigger during test execution.**
- **Xcode displayed "The scheme 'MemorizeAppUITests' is not configured for running" when attempting to run the test scheme directly.**
- **Test execution via the Test Navigator or Product → Test menu succeeded, but breakpoints in `setUp()` were ignored.**
- **All recommended debugging settings (Generate Debug Symbols, Optimization Level, Debug Information Format, etc.) were verified and correctly configured.**
- **Cleaning the build folder, deleting DerivedData, and restarting Xcode did not resolve the issue.**
- **The `setUp()` method was confirmed to be called (via `print()` statements), but breakpoints still did not work.**

## Analysis

- **Breakpoint Ignored in `setUp()`**
  - Despite correct debug settings, breakpoints in `setUp()` were not hit.
  - This behavior is consistent with known Xcode bugs or environment issues, especially in Xcode 15.x.
- **Scheme Configuration Warning**
  - Attempting to run the test target scheme directly resulted in a warning that the scheme is not configured for running.
  - Running tests via the Test Navigator or Product → Test menu is the correct workflow for test targets.
- **Debugging Limitations**
  - `print()` statements confirmed that `setUp()` was being called, but breakpoint debugging was unavailable.
  - This limits the ability to inspect variable states and step through initialization code.

## Resolution

- **Test Execution Workflow**
  - Use the Test Navigator or Product → Test menu to execute tests, not the Run action on the test target scheme.
- **Debugging Alternatives**
  - Rely on `print()` statements for logging during test initialization.
  - Consider using LLDB commands to set breakpoints manually during test execution if needed.
- **Environment Checks**
  - Ensure that all debug-related build settings are correct.
  - Repeat the process in a new project to isolate environment-specific issues.

## Lessons Learned

- **Test targets should not be executed via the Run action; use the Test action instead.**
- **Breakpoint debugging in `setUp()` may not always work due to Xcode or environment issues.**
- **`print()` statements are a reliable alternative for logging test initialization.**
- **Always verify build and debug settings when encountering debugging issues.**

## Next Steps

- **Proceed with testing and debugging `testCardMatching()` and other test methods.**
- **Continue to monitor for Xcode updates or environment changes that may resolve breakpoint issues.**
- **Document any further issues or workarounds encountered during UI test development.**
